    -send request
    -get response in specified time, else no success

    -send openSession w unique session id
    -get response in specified time, else no success

----listening------------

Layer3 => Open Session
    If no session is opened on actors side, actor can open new session
    set current and only valid address to the address of its counterpart(reactor)
    If reactor is listening only, it can send a positive response on session request and sets current address to the address of the actor

    If actor gets positive response from reactor => session is opened
    else actor retries till max_transmission_count_\w_response is reached

    if max_transmission_count_\w_response is reached, 
    only actor can close the session, 
    reactor switches to listening status
    if the communication stucks at reactors' side, the actor is also responsible for closing the session

If session is open
    Layer2 => transmit frame
         
Layer1 => Byte transmission
Layer0 => Bitwise transmission


-------------Session--------------------------
    receiver addr
    command
    data size (optional)
    memory segment/address
    segment address
    
    metainfo/statistics
        sentFrames
        lostFrames
        receivedFrames     


-------------Frame----------------------------
Size: 12 Bytes

Byte    Value
0       Address Receiver (Counterpart)
1       Address Sender
2       Command
3       MetaInfo (e.g. MemoryAddress)
4-11    Data


------------Commands------------------------
OpenSession
CloseSession
Get
Set
Ping/BC



Actor sends openSession
wait

Reactor receives openSession_cmd
sends response if available and sets fixed address to its counterparts address

Actor receives response => session opened and actor sets fixed address to its counterparts' address 
Communcation pipe is open and can be used in both directions (bidirectional)

Session open: both devices have changed their statuses from broadcast listener to a one-on-one communication channel
Session closed: both devices reset their listener addresses to bc address and their statuses to listen_all

Broadcast ping: receives addresses from all available devices

Ping: a known address to check the functionality of the devices

Get: request to get data of another device (volatile or persistent data)

Set: request to copy the data of the actor to another device (reactor)
